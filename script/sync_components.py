"""Generate the split component catalog from ESPHome's pre-built schema bundle.

Emits ``definitions/components.index.json`` plus per-id body files
under ``definitions/components/<id>.json``.

The schema repo (https://github.com/esphome/esphome-schema) publishes a
schema.zip per ESPHome release containing one JSON file per component.
That bundle drives VS Code's ESPHome extension and the official Builder
editor — it's the authoritative description of what each component
accepts in YAML. We use it as the primary source of structure, types,
defaults, and field descriptions.

A small amount of ESPHome introspection still happens for things the
schema doesn't capture:

- ``platform_defaults`` (``cv.SplitDefault`` per-target-platform values
  used by the backend to filter inapplicable fields)
- ``multi_conf`` (whether a component can be added more than once)
- ``supported_platforms`` (which target chips the component runs on)

Image URLs come from the docs repo's index page (the only MDX scraping
that survives the rewrite).

# LEGACY — DO NOT EXTEND unless there is genuinely no other option.
#
# Per-(component, field) overrides that hand-author the ConfigEntry the
# prebuilt schema fails to model: a custom ESPHome validator erases the
# inner schema upstream, so the bundle emits a bare string / opaque dict
# and we patch the real shape back in here. Each value is a partial
# ConfigEntry dict merged over the schema-derived one.
#
# Why this is a code smell: the data is hand-maintained and frozen, so
# it drifts from the live schema as ESPHome evolves — the override keeps
# winning even after upstream learns to emit the field correctly, and
# nobody notices until the rendered form is wrong. Every entry is a
# standing maintenance liability, not a feature.
#
# Before adding an entry, exhaust the alternatives: fix the upstream
# schema generator, recover the type in ``_convert_config_vars`` /
# ``_convert_field``, or backfill via ``_backfill_descriptions_from_mdx``.
# Only when none of those can express the field does a new override
# belong here — and then document the exact upstream gap that forces it,
# as the existing entries do.
# Common serial baud rates offered as a combo box for bare ``cv.int_`` baud
# fields the schema can't enumerate. Shared by the ``uart`` and ``logger``
# ``baud_rate`` overrides; ``allow_custom_value`` keeps any other rate typeable.

    ``float``) values:

    - ``vol.Range(min=1, max=15)`` → ``(1, 15)`` — surfaced.
    - ``vol.Range(min=0)`` (max unbounded) → ``None``, emit nothing
      so the data-type's natural bounds (or none) win.
    - ``vol.Range(max=TimePeriod(microseconds=4294967295))`` →
      ``None``, the wire format is numeric only.

    Disjoint chains where the intersection collapses to ``min > max``
    (e.g. ``cv.All(cv.Range(min=10), cv.Range(max=5))``) are an
    upstream schema bug — a field that accepts no value. The wire
    format ``[min, max]`` can't represent "accepts nothing," and a
    serialised ``[10, 5]`` would clamp wrong on the frontend. Log a
    warning so the upstream bug surfaces in the next sync run, then
    return ``None`` so the field stays unbounded — the compile-time
    validator catches the actual incompatibility.

    ``vol.Any`` branches aren't traversed: a field declared as
    ``vol.Any(vol.Range(min=1, max=10), vol.Range(min=20, max=30))``
    would mean "value is in [1, 10] OR [20, 30]," which the wire
    format's single ``[min, max]`` pair can't express. Skipping
    ``vol.Any`` entirely is the conservative choice — the field
    falls through to its ``data_type`` defaults (or no bounds), and
    the user still gets a compile-time validation error if they
    pick a number neither branch accepts. None of today's catalog
    components hit this shape; the limitation is documented for
    when a future schema introduces it.

    The schema bundle's ``data_type`` field surfaces this for fixed-
    width integers (``uint8_t`` → ``[0, 255]``) but not for
    ``positive_int`` chained with a ``cv.Range(...)``, which is the
    ``bluetooth_proxy.connection_slots`` case (issue #426 — the
    visual editor accepts any positive integer because the
    ``cv.Range(min=1, max=15)`` is dropped from the bundle).
